Alaskan Is McCain’s Choice; First Woman on G.O.P. Ticket - The New York Times
advertisementby michael cooper and elisabeth bumilleraug 29 2008dayton ohio senator john mccain astonished the political world on friday by naming sarah palin a little known governor of alaska and self described hockey mom with almost no foreign policy experience as his running mate on the republican presidential ticket ms palin 44 a social conservative former union member and mother of five who has been governor for two years was on none of the widely discussed mccain campaign short lists for vice president in selecting her mr mccain reached far outside the washington beltway in an election year in which the democratic presidential candidate senator barack obama is running on a platform of change  she s not from these parts and she s not from washington but when you get to know her you re going to be as impressed as i am mr mccain told a midday rally of 15 000 people in a basketball arena here shortly before ms palin with her husband and four of her children strode out onto the stage within moments ms palin made an explicit appeal to the disappointed supporters of senator hillary rodham clinton by praising not only mrs clinton but also the only other woman in american history who has been on a presidential ticket geraldine a ferraro walter f mondale s democratic running mate in 1984 advertisement hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america aren t finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all ms palin said to huge applause advertisementms palin and mr mccain then embarked on a bus tour across ohio and north into western pennsylvania to pittsburgh a route that took in a wide swath of the central battleground in this year s presidential campaign mr mccain s pick ms palin who opposes abortion played especially well among evangelicals and other social conservatives who have always viewed mr mccain warily and who have been jittery in recent weeks because of reports that mr mccain was considering naming a running mate who favors abortion rights the mccain campaign sees ms palin as a kindred spirit to mr mccain particularly in her history of taking heat from fellow republicans for bucking them on issues and spotlighting their ethical failings like mr mccain s her political profile is built in part on her opposition to questionable government spending projects but they differ on a number of policies ms palin opposed mr mccain on one of the most prominent alaskan issues she supports drilling for oil in the arctic national wildlife refuge and mr mccain opposes it much to the consternation of some republicans mr mccain s environmental policy accepts that global warming is driven by pollution ms palin has said she is not convinced a spokeswoman for ms palin maria comella said governor palin not only stands with john mccain in his belief that global warming is a critical issue that must be addressed but she has been a leader in addressing climate change ms palin a former mayor of the small town of wasilla an anchorage suburb rose to prominence as a whistle blower uncovering ethical misconduct in state government her selection amounted to a gamble that an infusion of new leadership and the novelty of the republican party s first female candidate for vice president would more than compensate for the risk that ms palin could undercut one of the mccain campaign s central arguments that mr obama is too inexperienced to be president democrats and at least some shocked republicans questioned the judgment of mr mccain who has said repeatedly on the campaign trail that his running mate should have the qualifications to immediately step into the role of commander in chief mr mccain s words on the matter have had more than usual resonance this year because of his age he turned 72 on friday and hopes to be the oldest person ever elected to a first term and his history with skin cancer ms palin appears to have traveled very little outside the united states in july 2007 she had to get a passport before she visited members of the alaska national guard stationed in kuwait according to her deputy communications director sharon leighow she also visited wounded troops in germany during that trip advertisementmr mccain s announcement of ms palin came in the immediate afterglow that democrats were enjoying from their nomination of mr obama and for one news cycle at least as republicans intended ms palin effectively muffled the news coverage of mr obama s acceptance speech to 80 000 people at the democratic national convention in denver on thursday night mr obama wished her well in a call from his campaign bus  he also wished her good luck but not too much luck said robert gibbs a senior strategist to mr obama mr obama s fellow democrats were considerably less welcoming and most said they were flabbergasted by what they characterized as a desperate cynical or dangerous choice given ms palin s lack of any experience in national security  on his 72nd birthday this is the guy s judgment of who he wants one heartbeat from the presidency said representative rahm emanuel of illinois chairman of the house democratic caucus who said the selection smacked of political panic please mr mccain s advisers said friday that mr mccain was well aware that ms palin would be criticized for her lack of foreign policy experience but that he viewed her as exceptionally talented and intelligent and that he felt she would be able to be educated quickly  she s going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years and most doctors think that he ll be around at least that long said charlie black one of mr mccain s top advisers making light of concerns about mr mccain s health which mr mccain s doctors reported as excellent in may please verify you re not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please re enter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to view all new york times newsletters many conservatives said that the choice would energize them giving mr mccain the support of a highly active group of voters and volunteers whose support was crucial to both of president bush s victories  they re beyond ecstatic said ralph reed the former head of the christian coalition ms palin is known to conservatives for opting not to have an abortion after learning that the child she was carrying her youngest had down syndrome it is almost impossible to exaggerate how important that is to the conservative faith community mr reed said the choice of ms palin was reminiscent of former president george bush s selection of dan quayle then a barely known senator from indiana as his running mate in 1988 advertisementit was far from clear friday whether adding a woman to the ticket would persuade clinton supporters to come over to the republicans given ms palin s differences with mrs clinton on issues from abortion rights to her positions on health care and climate change some women said that the pick could be seen as patronizing a suggestion that women would vote based on a candidate s sex rather than on positions but others saw the choice of ms palin as a welcome step  i think it s absolutely fantastic said kimberly myers a retired transit worker in pittsburgh who had originally supported mrs clinton but who said that mr mccain s choice would win him her vote she s actually broken the glass ceiling as they began gathering in minneapolis st paul for the start of their convention on monday some republican delegates said they were concerned that ms palin did not have the experience in foreign policy or national security to be commander in chief  we re in a global war we re in a global economy so it s less than honest if someone says that this woman is qualified to lead america right now said todd burkhalter a republican delegate from mobile ala her selection was kept secret until friday morning after the two men who had been rumored to be on mr mccain s short list former gov mitt romney of massachusetts and gov tim pawlenty of minnesota let it be known they were out of the running the mccain campaign said that mr mccain first met ms palin in february this year at the national governors association meeting in washington and came away extraordinarily impressed but mr mccain apparently has spent little time with her ms palin flew to flagstaff ariz on wednesday evening to meet with two of mr mccain s senior campaign aides steve schmidt and mark salter said jill hazelbaker a campaign spokeswoman the group met at the flagstaff home of bob delgado the chief executive officer of the hensley corporation the family business of cindy mccain mr mccain s wife after meeting with mrs mccain there the next morning ms palin was taken to the mccain vacation compound near sedona where mr mccain offered her a spot on the ticket at 11 a m advertisementshe flew to ohio later that day with mr schmidt and mr salter and checked into a hotel as the upton family ms palin s children who had been told they were going to ohio to celebrate their parents 20th wedding anniversary on friday were informed there that their mother would be the republican vice presidential nominee thursday evening she had a final meeting with mr mccain one adviser suggested that although mr mccain was sure about his choice he wanted to sit down with ms palin one last time before he made what he knew would be an astonishing announcement the next morning as recently as last month ms palin appeared to dismiss the importance of the vice presidency in an interview with larry kudlow of cnbc who asked her about her prospects for the job  i still can t answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the v p does every day ms palin told mr kudlow i m used to being very productive and working real hard michael cooper reported from dayton and new concord ohio and pittsburgh and elisabeth bumiller from washington reporting
